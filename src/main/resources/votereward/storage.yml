# CHANGES TO THIS CONFIG REQUIRE A RESTART.
# SWAPPING FROM YAML TO MARIADB WILL MOVE ALL DATA ON STARTUP.

storage-type: YAML # YAML, MARIADB
sql:
  database: "neo_mods"
  address: "localhost:3306"
  username: "root"
  password: ""

# If you're swapping to MARIADB to go cross-server:
#  - Only install nuvotifier-fabric on a single server.
#  - Make sure offline votes direct to that server.
#  - Connect VoteReward to the same database on every server.
# VoteReward will handle the rest.
